# DIGITAL BLIND BOX — PROJECT CONTEXT & INSTRUCTIONS

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

I am building an interactive digital blind box experience designed primarily for mobile phones.

The core experience is:

1. A user lands on the website.
2. They see a cute, polished 3D blind box.
3. They are prompted to tap the box.
4. The box shakes with anticipation.
5. The box opens.
6. A randomly selected collectible sticker emerges from inside.
7. The user sees the sticker name and rarity, if applicable.
8. The user can save the sticker PNG to their device.
9. The user can share the sticker using the native mobile share sheet where supported.
10. The user can open another box and receive another random sticker.

The experience should feel like opening a real collectible blind box, translated into a digital interactive experience.

The goal is NOT to create a generic 3D website or a generic mobile game.

It should feel:

* cute
* collectible
* playful
* tactile
* visually polished
* simple
* slightly surprising
* design-led
* fast
* mobile-first

The physical/visual artwork I provide is the source of truth for the visual identity.

---

# 2. SOURCE ASSETS

I will provide several assets for this project.

These may include:

* A hand-drawn blind-box schematic/reference
* Finished transparent PNG sticker artwork
* A 3D GLB/GLTF blind-box model generated separately
* Branding, typography or other visual references

DO NOT replace supplied artwork with AI-generated placeholder artwork unless explicitly instructed.

DO NOT redesign the blind box independently.

If an implementation decision conflicts with the supplied artwork/reference, ask me or explain the conflict before changing the design.

---

# 3. TECH STACK

The preferred initial stack is:

* Vite
* React
* JavaScript
* Three.js
* @react-three/fiber
* @react-three/drei
* CSS

Keep the project lightweight.

Do not introduce additional libraries unless there is a clear reason.

Potential libraries such as GSAP may be introduced later if they provide a meaningful advantage for animation, but do not add dependencies simply because they are available.

There should be:

* no backend
* no database
* no authentication
* no user accounts

unless I explicitly request them later.

The first version should be a static client-side application.

---

# 4. TARGET PLATFORM

The primary target is:

**Mobile Safari on iPhone.**

The website should also work on:

* Android mobile browsers
* Chrome desktop
* Safari desktop

Mobile is the priority.

Assume that many users will arrive via an NFC tag or QR code, potentially on mobile data.

The experience therefore needs to load quickly and feel immediate.

---

# 5. PERFORMANCE PRIORITIES

Performance is extremely important.

The site may be accessed from a physical NFC tag, so the user should not have to wait unnecessarily before interacting with the experience.

Prioritise:

* small GLB file size
* optimised textures
* compressed PNGs where possible
* minimal JavaScript
* efficient React rendering
* efficient Three.js rendering
* minimal dependencies
* lazy loading where appropriate
* avoiding unnecessary re-renders
* mobile GPU performance

Aim for a total initial experience that is lightweight enough to work comfortably over mobile data.

Do not sacrifice visual quality unnecessarily, but always consider whether an asset can be made significantly smaller without a noticeable visual difference.

---

# 6. PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

Keep the code modular and understandable.

Prefer a structure similar to:

src/
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
├── styles.css
│
├── components/
│   ├── BlindBox.jsx
│   ├── BoxScene.jsx
│   ├── StickerReveal.jsx
│   ├── RevealResult.jsx
│   ├── LoadingScreen.jsx
│   └── ActionButtons.jsx
│
├── data/
│   └── stickers.js
│
├── utils/
│   └── randomSticker.js
│
└── assets/

This structure can change if there is a good technical reason.

Avoid putting the entire application into one enormous component.

Keep data, randomisation logic, 3D rendering, animation and UI reasonably separated.

---

# 7. 3D BLIND BOX

The blind box will be provided as a GLB/GLTF model.

It should be rendered using Three.js / React Three Fiber.

The box should:

* sit naturally in the scene
* have appropriate lighting
* have a transparent/clean surrounding environment
* be responsive to viewport size
* maintain its proportions
* look good from a 3/4 perspective
* work well on mobile GPUs

If possible, the lid should be a separate mesh/object so that it can physically open.

Do not replace a 3D animation with a flat 2D image unless specifically instructed.

---

# 8. INITIAL STATE

When the user first arrives:

* The box should be closed.
* The scene should feel calm.
* The box may have a subtle idle animation.
* The user should understand that the box is interactive.

There should be a simple instruction such as:

"Tap to open"

The UI should not overwhelm the artwork.

---

# 9. OPENING EXPERIENCE

The opening should feel physical and tactile.

Preferred sequence:

1. User taps the box.
2. Interaction becomes temporarily locked.
3. Short anticipation movement.
4. Box shakes.
5. Shake increases slightly in intensity.
6. Box settles.
7. Brief anticipation pause.
8. Lid opens.
9. Short reveal pause.
10. Sticker emerges from inside.
11. Sticker settles into position.
12. Sticker information appears.
13. Save/share actions become available.

The animation should have intentional pacing.

Do NOT make it feel like:

* a generic website transition
* a casino machine
* an overly flashy mobile game
* an excessive particle effect
* an NFT/crypto-style reveal

The desired feeling is closer to physically opening a cute collectible toy.

All important timing values should be configurable rather than buried throughout the code.

---

# 10. STICKER SYSTEM

All stickers will be transparent PNG files.

They will live in:

/public/stickers/

The sticker system should be data-driven.

Use a configuration structure similar to:

{
id: "sticker-01",
name: "Sticker Name",
file: "/stickers/sticker-01.png",
rarity: "common",
weight: 40
}

Potential properties:

* id
* name
* file
* rarity
* weight

Do not hard-code individual sticker behaviour into the animation.

Adding a new sticker should ideally require only adding the new asset and configuration entry.

---

# 11. RANDOMISATION

The sticker should NOT be selected when the page initially loads.

The sticker should be selected when the user begins opening the blind box.

Initially, all stickers may have equal probability.

The system should support weighted probabilities later.

Example:

Common:
weight 40

Rare:
weight 10

Secret:
weight 2

The weighted randomisation should be handled by a reusable utility function rather than mixed directly into the UI component.

The selected sticker must remain fixed throughout that reveal.

Do not allow accidental double-taps to reroll the sticker.

---

# 12. STICKER REVEAL

The sticker should feel as though it physically comes out of the box.

Preferred behaviour:

* starts inside/below the box
* moves upward
* scales slightly
* optionally rotates subtly
* becomes fully visible
* settles naturally

Avoid simply fading a PNG into the centre of the screen.

The sticker should become the visual focus after the box opens.

Do not distort the original sticker proportions.

---

# 13. RARITY

The system should support rarity categories, for example:

* Common
* Rare
* Secret

However, rarity should not necessarily be displayed before the reveal.

The user should discover the result first.

Do not expose probability percentages unless explicitly requested.

Avoid making the experience feel like gambling.

This is a collectible/creative experience.

---

# 14. RESULT SCREEN

After the sticker is revealed, show:

* sticker artwork
* sticker name
* rarity, if configured
* Save button
* Share button
* Open another box button

The design should remain simple and visually focused on the sticker.

---

# 15. SAVE FUNCTION

The Save button should download the original sticker PNG asset.

Important:

DO NOT screenshot the website.

DO NOT save a screenshot of the Three.js canvas.

The downloaded file should be the original transparent PNG.

Use a sensible filename based on the sticker name.

Example:

sleepy-toffee.png

---

# 16. SHARE FUNCTION

Where supported, use the Web Share API.

Ideally the user should be able to share the actual sticker PNG through the native mobile share sheet.

If file sharing is unsupported:

* provide a graceful fallback
* do not break the experience
* allow the user to save/download the sticker instead

The application should detect browser support rather than assuming the API exists.

---

# 17. RESET / OPEN ANOTHER BOX

After a reveal, the user should be able to select:

"Open another box"

This should:

* reset the box to its closed state
* remove the current sticker
* reset the animation state
* allow another random selection
* avoid a full page reload

The next opening should be treated as a new reveal.

---

# 18. MOBILE UX

Design for touch first.

Important requirements:

* large tap targets
* no hover-dependent interactions
* no horizontal scrolling
* safe-area support
* appropriate use of 100dvh
* responsive canvas
* portrait-first design
* good behaviour on smaller iPhones
* good behaviour on larger phones
* graceful desktop fallback

The website should feel like a small interactive experience rather than a desktop website squeezed onto a phone.

---

# 19. LOADING EXPERIENCE

Because the experience contains a 3D model and image assets, provide a lightweight loading state.

Never show:

* a blank white page
* an unstyled Three.js canvas
* broken model geometry while assets are loading

The loading experience should be minimal and branded.

Once assets are ready, transition naturally into the blind-box screen.

---

# 20. ERROR HANDLING

The application should gracefully handle:

* missing GLB model
* failed texture
* missing sticker PNG
* unsupported Web Share API
* WebGL limitations
* failed asset loading

Do not allow a single missing sticker to crash the entire experience.

Errors should be useful during development but should not expose ugly technical errors to normal users.

---

# 21. ACCESSIBILITY

Even though this is a visual interactive experience, maintain reasonable accessibility.

Consider:

* accessible button labels
* keyboard interaction on desktop
* visible focus states
* readable text
* sufficient contrast
* reduced-motion support where practical

If the user has reduced motion enabled, provide a simplified animation rather than completely breaking the experience.

---

# 22. DESIGN PRINCIPLES

The experience should feel:

* cute
* collectible
* charming
* tactile
* premium but approachable
* playful
* visually intentional

Avoid:

* generic SaaS UI
* excessive gradients
* excessive glassmorphism
* overly complex menus
* unnecessary navigation
* excessive particles
* casino aesthetics
* crypto/NFT aesthetics
* generic AI-generated design language
* excessive animations competing with the sticker

The supplied artwork should always take priority.

---

# 23. DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT attempt to build the entire project in one step.

Build incrementally.

Preferred development order:

PHASE 1
Project setup + 3D model rendering

PHASE 2
Responsive mobile layout

PHASE 3
Tap interaction

PHASE 4
Box shake animation

PHASE 5
Lid opening

PHASE 6
Sticker randomisation

PHASE 7
Sticker emergence animation

PHASE 8
Result UI

PHASE 9
Save functionality

PHASE 10
Native share functionality

PHASE 11
Reset / open another box

PHASE 12
Loading and error states

PHASE 13
Performance optimisation

PHASE 14
Production audit

Do not implement later phases until the earlier phase is working correctly.

---

# 24. HOW I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME

I am not an expert in every part of the web/Three.js stack.

Explain important technical decisions in straightforward language.

Do not overwhelm me with unnecessary technical detail.

When there are multiple reasonable approaches, recommend one and briefly explain why.

Do not make major architectural decisions silently.

If an implementation choice could significantly affect:

* visual appearance
* performance
* maintainability
* hosting
* mobile compatibility

explain the decision before proceeding.

---

# 25. WHEN DEBUGGING

When something breaks:

1. Identify the likely root cause.
2. Explain the problem briefly.
3. Make the smallest appropriate fix.
4. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
5. Retest the affected functionality.
6. Explain what changed.

Do not rewrite large parts of the project simply because something small is broken.

Preserve working functionality.

---

# 26. CODE QUALITY

Prefer:

* simple code
* readable names
* reusable functions
* reusable components
* clear state management
* comments only where useful
* configurable animation constants
* no unnecessary abstraction

Avoid:

* over-engineering
* unnecessary dependencies
* duplicated logic
* giant components
* hard-coded sticker logic
* hard-coded probabilities scattered across files
* unnecessary backend infrastructure

---

# 27. IMPORTANT RULE

This project is intended to become a real public-facing interactive experience.

Therefore, always think about the actual user journey:

NFC / QR CODE
↓
WEBSITE LOADS
↓
3D BOX APPEARS
↓
TAP
↓
SHAKE
↓
OPEN
↓
RANDOM STICKER
↓
SAVE / SHARE
↓
OPEN ANOTHER

Every technical decision should support that experience.

Do not optimise for developer cleverness at the expense of the user's experience.
